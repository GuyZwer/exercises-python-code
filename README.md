Alternating Characters
----------------------
----------------------
Shashank likes strings in which consecutive characters are different. For example, he likes ABABA, while he doesn't like ABAA. Given a string containing characters AA and BB only, he wants to change it into a string he likes. To do this, he is allowed to delete the characters in the string.

Your task is to find the minimum number of required deletions..

Input Format

The first line contains an integer TT, i.e. the number of test cases.
The next TT lines contain a string each.

Output Format

For each test case, print the minimum number of deletions required.

Constraints

1≤T≤101≤T≤10
1≤1≤ length of string ≤105≤105


Sample Input

5

AAAA
BBBBB
ABABABAB
BABABA
AAABBB

Sample Output

3
4
0
0
4

Explanation

AAAA ⟹⟹ A, 3 deletions
BBBBB ⟹⟹ B, 4 deletions
ABABABAB ⟹⟹ ABABABAB, 0 deletions
BABABA ⟹⟹ BABABA, 0 deletions
AAABBB ⟹⟹ AB, 4 deletions because to convert it to AB we need to delete 2 A's and 2 B's

Set .add()
----------------------------
If we want to add a single element to an existing set, we can use the .add() operation.
It adds the element to the set and returns 'None'.

Example

>>> s = set('HackerRank')
>>> s.add('H')
>>> print s
set(['a', 'c', 'e', 'H', 'k', 'n', 'r', 'R'])
>>> print s.add('HackerRank')
None
>>> print s
set(['a', 'c', 'e', 'HackerRank', 'H', 'k', 'n', 'r', 'R'])


Task

Apply your knowledge of the .add() operation to help your friend Rupal.

Rupal has a huge collection of country stamps. She decided to count the total number of distinct country stamps in her collection. She asked for your help. You pick the stamps one by one from a stack of country stamps.

Find the total number of distinct country stamps.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer , the total number of country stamps.
The next lines contains the countrey's name where the stamp is from.

Constraints

Output Format

Output the total number of distinct country stamps on a single line.

Sample Input

7
UK
China
USA
France
New Zealand
UK
France 

Sample Output

The Captain's Room
------------------
Mr. Anant Asankhya is the manager at the INFINITE hotel. The hotel has an infinite amount of rooms.

One fine day, a finite number of tourists come to stay at the hotel.
The tourists consist of:
→ A Captain.
→ An unknown group of families consisting of members per group where ≠ .

The Captain was given a separate room, and the rest were given one room per group.

Mr. Anant has an unordered list of randomly arranged room entries. The list consists of the room numbers for all of the tourists. The room numbers will appear times per group except for the Captain's room.

Mr. Anant needs you to help him find the Captain's room number.
The total number of tourists or the total number of groups of families is not known to you.
You only know the value of and the room number list.

Input Format

The first line consists of an integer, , the size of each group.
The second line contains the unordered elements of the room number list.

Constraints

Output Format

Output the Captain's room number.

Sample Input

5
1 2 3 6 5 4 4 2 5 3 6 1 6 5 3 2 4 1 2 5 1 4 3 6 8 4 3 1 5 6 2 

Sample Output

8

Explanation

The list of room numbers contains elements. Since is , there must be groups of families. In the given list, all of the numbers repeat times except for room number .
Hence, is the Captain's room number.
